# ðŸ“‚ OsloMet2025 Repository - Exercises & Resources

Welcome to the **OsloMet2025** repository! This repository contains exercises and useful resources to support your learning.

## ðŸš€ Exercises for today on Colab - you need to have google account 
You can access the Colab repository with exercises here:  
[â–¶ Google Colab - OsloMet2025 Exercises](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Mpyixpcu75rwM17OolBFIogP9kBqpw-T#scrollTo=CTvu5SmoXvOn)
Remember to make a copy of this repository as this one is only "read modus"


## ðŸ’» Run on Binder (Alternative to Colab, no account nessesary but maybe more problematic as resources are limited so this is not recomended solution for parts 2-5)
If you prefer **not to use Google Colab**, you can run the exercises on **Binder** instead:

1. Visit **[MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/)**  
2. Enter the GitHub repository URL:  https://github.com/bazyliszek/OsloMet2025
3. Enter File to open (in JupyterLab): Biopython_Basics.ipynb


## ðŸš€ You can also use python on your computer but you will need to fix instaltion yourself (not recommended) 
You can access the Colab repository with exercises here:  
[â–¶ Python](biopython_basics.py)
